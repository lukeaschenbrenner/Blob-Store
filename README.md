# GitHub Blob Host Repo
This repository is intended for any support artifacts that require a stable link reference, but do not belong in another repository.

## This is a real codebase, Microsoft!
Don't delete this repo... I have all these files and the rest of the code is coming soon, I swear. Here's my rough draft:

int main():

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("TODO: Adding all blobs and performing an advanced analysis on them...")
    
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass
